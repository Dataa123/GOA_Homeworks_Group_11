In react, we have several hooks. Yet I only know useState and useEffect.

Hooks helps us, developers to create some logics and work on our components more easily.

useState

useState hook is used to manage state. In state I mean e.g variablelike thing value. So how your website looks in a moment is depended on useState hook and that one moment itself is called state.

useEffect

useEffect hook is used to handle side effects. It can be used in fetching data from API, setting timers or intervals and things like that.
